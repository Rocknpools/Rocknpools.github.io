    My effort at GomSpace was focused on the development of a k-band antenna for inter-satellite communications. The outcome of this project was a product fully compliant with mechanical, electrical, and thermal requirements therefore ready to be tested for fly in space. The realization of this goal involved a full-time commitment at GomSpace to better handle all the strict requirements (especially mechanical and thermal ones) and practical aspects that have to be fulfilled before the satellite is deployed in space.
