    This paper presents an X-band circularly polarized patch antenna.
    High gain, in combination with a dual-sense circular polarization, makes the proposed antenna particularly attractive for space applications involving small satellites. With the proposed design, it is possible to employ only one antenna rather than two (RHCP and LHCP), thus saving space on the aircraft, which is clearly a limited resource.

    This paper presents an antenna for a TT&C system consisting of four antennas to achieve a wide quasi-isotropic coverage. The developed low-cost antenna can be used for small-satellite data downlink where only two right hand circular polarized (RHCP) antennas and two left hand circular polarized (LHCP) antennas would be required since each antenna has an adequate CP gain on a wide angle.

    This paper presents a wideband or dual-band circular disk antenna with high gain and sidelobe suppression (SLS). The antenna has a single layer and single-fed configuration. Wideband or dual-band behavior can be achieved with high gain and SLS.
