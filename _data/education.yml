    My experience at Aalborg University started during the final part of my master degree as an Erasmus student at the electronic systems department, more precisely at the Antennas, Propagation, and Millimetre-Wave Systems Section (APMS). The subsequent step was my Ph.D. in mm-waves antennas for small satellite communications.

    Small satellites have drawn significant attention in the communication industry as miniaturization technologies make it feasible to build smaller satellites than those built a decade ago. The primary concern of traditional satellite communication systems is the high cost. To remain competitive in this emerging business area, small-satellites solutions must meet flexible customer requirements, e.g. multi-frequency bands and data rates, inter-satellite links) in a cost-effective way. However, using currently available low-frequency radio technologies will result in some limitations like design with too large antennas and circuit power consumptions that are not compatible with the “Smallsat” approach. Millimeter-wave and beam steerable antennas are one of the most promising candidates for future small satellite applications.    The outcome of this Ph.D. project could be used for the next-generation wireless communication systems for small-satellite applications.

    The University of Catania is where I learned most of the key skills that I have taken through my career. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at the university and learned a lot about a healthy work-life balance.
